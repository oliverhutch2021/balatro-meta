# Running the jobs on your PC

Heavy jobs run on your PC (WSL2 Ubuntu), one command each. Claude writes and tests the code, then
says **Your turn** in the chat when a run is ready. This file holds the exact steps.

## How it works

- The repo lives in `H:\balatro-meta`; in Ubuntu that's `/mnt/h/balatro-meta`.
- New code from Claude arrives as `.sync/claude.bundle`. `make sync` applies it, and every job runs it first.
- The engine is Rust. Its build and the Python environment live on the WSL disk
  (`~/.cache/balatro-meta`, `~/.venvs/balatro-meta`), so the Windows drive only holds the code and results.
- Every job can be stopped with Ctrl+C and resumed by running the same command again. Jobs run at low
  priority, so the PC stays usable, just slower.
- When a job finishes it commits its results, then writes `.sync/DONE-<job>.txt` and
  `.sync/from-pc.bundle`. Tell Claude in the chat; it reads both straight from the folder.
- For long runs, stop the PC from sleeping: Settings > System > Power > Screen and sleep > "Never" while
  plugged in.

## Step 1: one-time setup (about 20 minutes)

Run the commands in Ubuntu. From PowerShell, `bash bootstrap.sh` and `wsl make <target>` work too.

In Ubuntu:

```
cd /mnt/h/balatro-meta
git init -q -b main
git pull -q --ff-only .sync/claude.bundle main
bash bootstrap.sh
```

It installs make, LuaJIT, uv, Rust and Python 3.12, builds the engine, and installs PyTorch with CUDA for
the 4070 Ti (about 3 GB; `SKIP_GPU=1 bash bootstrap.sh` leaves that for later). It asks for your Ubuntu
password once and ends with a check table. If any line says FAIL, paste the table into the chat.

Result commits are made under your name. If the check table says the Git identity is missing:

```
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```

Once the empty GitHub repo exists, connect it and push:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/balatro-meta.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: smoke test (about 2 minutes)

```
make smoke
```

Builds the engine, runs every Rust and Python test, and checks the machine. When it prints "All done",
tell Claude in the chat.

## Step 3: the RNG gate (a few minutes)

```
make rng-check
```

Compares the engine's random numbers with LuaJIT on about 2.4 million cases (seed hashes, every kind
of stream draw, the 13-place rounding and deck shuffles), twice: first with Ubuntu's LuaJIT, then on the
game's own `lua51.dll` (LuaJIT 2.0.5 with the Windows C runtime), which it runs through your Windows
Python (miniconda is found automatically). Every value must match bit for bit. It also saves a few facts
about the game's runtime to `results/rng/game_runtime.txt`. This is the RNG part of the phase 1 gate.

If it can't find Windows Python or Balatro, it says which setting to give, for example
`BM_WIN_PYTHON=/mnt/c/Users/<you>/miniconda3/python.exe make rng-check`.

## Later steps

Claude adds each one here when it's ready: the engine speed benchmark and leak test (rest of phase 1), the
full content (phase 2), checks against the real game with BalatroBot (phase 3), and training (phase 4).

## If something goes wrong

- `make status` shows which steps are done; logs are in `.sync/logs/`.
- A step failed: paste the last 20 lines of its log into the chat.
- "uncommitted changes": a tracked file was edited. `git stash` puts the edit aside, or ask Claude.
- "detected dubious ownership": run `git config --global --add safe.directory /mnt/h/balatro-meta`.
- "cargo: command not found" in an old terminal: run `source ~/.cargo/env`, or open a new terminal.
- Ubuntu can't see `H:`: check `ls /mnt/h`. If H: is a network drive, tell Claude.
